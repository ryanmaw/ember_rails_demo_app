1. Create a controller with a view called index
	rails g controller Home index

2. Create a template for Ember to render
	Ember looks for an application template by default that we need to create

	//app/assets/javascrips/templates/application.js.emblem

	Restart the server and then checkout local host.

* Note if you get an error within the ember debugger that says handlbars error h1 not found blah blah blah...
	Install Emblem.js Sytax Highlighting to sublime text.

	That's what solved it for me
