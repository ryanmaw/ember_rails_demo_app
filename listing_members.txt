1. Add a Route

	Everything always starts with routes!

	Create a resource path set to root

2. Create a Route Object

	Next we need to fetch all the lead records.  Let's create a MembersRoute

	App.MembersRoute = Ember.Route.extend
		model: -> @store.find 'member'

	model is a hook that's called whenever the route is entered
	This result is then available to the controller, view, and template

	TEST: Visit your root route and look at the “Data” tab in the Ember Inspector. You should see all of your 			  Members.
