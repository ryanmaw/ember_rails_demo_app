1. Add a Route

	Everything always starts with routes!

	Create a resource path set to root

2. Create a Route Object

	Next we need to fetch all the lead records.  Let's create a MembersRoute

	App.MembersRoute = Ember.Route.extend
		model: -> @store.find 'member'

	model is a hook that's called whenever the route is entered
	This result is then available to the controller, view, and template

	TEST: Visit your root route and look at the “Data” tab in the Ember Inspector. You should see all of your 			  Members.

3. Create the Template

	Showing Full Names

		We can create a property in the model to display full names

4. Sorting Members

	Members aren't in any particular order so far. 

	You can sort arrays of models by specifying sortProperties in the controller.
	Lets make a controller!

	In the controllers we can sortProperties.  sortProperties takes an array of string with the highest priority first.git
