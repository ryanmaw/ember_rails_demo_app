1. Ember Data 

	Ember Data is the standard for handling data.

	Ember needs a Model for Members just as Rails dose. 

	Ember Data gives us the DS.Model object which we'll extend

	Ember will automatically read in the json api's atts.  

	Ember Data only has 4 types. string, number, boolean, date

	ASIDE about DS.Model

		DS.Model has a bunch of methods and properties.

		model.save()
		model.rollback()
		model.destroyRecord()

		The main difference between the DS.Model object and the Ember.Object is that you cannot create them the same way.

		To create a new DS.Model instance you have to go through the store.

		@store.createRecord('modelName', firstName: "John" , lastName: "Snow")

		Store encapsulates you app's knowledge of all the active DS.Model instances.
		Store has to do more behind the scenes work when you create a Model instance
