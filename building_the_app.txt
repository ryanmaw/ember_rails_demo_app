Building The APP

1. Preparing Routes

	Enable AutoLocation to get rid of the # in urls. 

	/router.js.coffee
	App.Router.reopen
		location: 'auto'
		rootURL: '/'

2. Create Catch All Rails Route

	At the bottom of routes.rb add
	get '*path', to: 'home#index'

3. Creating a Rails API for Ember

	The API allows communication between Ember and Rails backend

	/store.js.coffee
	App.ApplicationAdapter = DS.ActiveModelAdapter.extend()

	This line allows Ember to communicate with the Rails backend through Active Model Serializes.
	Active Model Serialize is actually a gem but it is a dependency of Ember-Rails.

4. Version the API Namespace
	
	/store.js.coffee

	Because we will be versioning our API we need to give the namespace a prepend with the version number

	DS.RESTAdapter.reopen
		namespace: 'api/v1'

5. Modeling Leads

	rails g migration create_leads first_name:string last_name:string email:string phone:string status:string notes:text

	migrate

6. Create Member model by Hand

7. Set up Serializer 
	
	To set up the Serializer we need to list out all the attribute you want to serialize into JSON and send it to Ember

	rails g serializer Member

	Don't forget to add in the attributes

8. The Rails API Controller
	
	Add routes to /routes.rb

	namespace :api do
		namespace :v1 do
			resources :members
